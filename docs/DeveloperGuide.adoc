By: `T10-3`      Since: `Oct 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/XmlAdaptedWord.java[`XmlAdaptedWord.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.learnvocabulary.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteWord.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `LearnVocabularyChangedEvent` when LearnVocabulary's data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteWordEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `WordListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LearnVocabularyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a word) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteWordSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the LearnVocabulary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Word>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the LearnVocabulary data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.learnvocabulary.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedLearnVocabulary`.
It extends `LearnVocabulary` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `learnVocabularyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#commit()` -- Saves the current learnvocabulary state in its history.
* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#undo()` -- Restores the previous learnvocabulary state from its history.
* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone learnvocabulary state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()` and `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedLearnVocabulary` will be initialized with the initial learnvocabulary state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single learnvocabulary state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the learnvocabulary. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, causing the modified state of the learnvocabulary after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `learnVocabularyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted learnvocabulary state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, causing another modified learnvocabulary state to be saved into the `learnVocabularyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, so the learnvocabulary state will not be saved into the `learnVocabularyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous learnvocabulary state, and restores the learnvocabulary to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial learnvocabulary state, then there are no previous learnvocabulary states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoLearnVocabulary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the learnvocabulary to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `learnVocabularyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest learnvocabulary state, then there are no undone learnvocabulary states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoLearnVocabulary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the learnvocabulary, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()` or `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()`. Thus, the `learnVocabularyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `learnVocabularyStateList`, all learnvocabulary states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire learnvocabulary.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of learnvocabulary states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedLearnVocabulary`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::learn[]
=== Learn feature
==== Current Implementation

The learn mechanism is facilitated by the `Dictionary` class.
The backbone of LearnVocabulary would have to be the `Learn` command, because it allows the user to query words from the internet and parse their meanings into readable format for storage.
The learn command is indicated as `Learn` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It enables the user to "learn" a word from the world wide web.
This command is requires the use of Internet, should there be an absence of Internet connection, it has already been taken care of via throwing an Exception.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Dictionary#invoke()` -- calls the main function of Dictionary which links it to LearnVocabulary
* `Dictionary#isConnectedToInternet()` -- checks to see if there is an Internet connection established.
* `Dictionary#isWordInOnlineDictionary(Word)` -- checks to see if it is a valid word and if it exists in Dictionary.com
* `Dictionary#convertWord(Word)` -- converts word into first letter is in big caps, whilst the others are in small caps.
* `Dictionary#isValidWord(Word)` -- checks to see if it word contains any illegal characters.

`Dictionary#invoke()` is exposed in the `LearnCommandParser` class as `LearnCommandParser#parse()`, while all the other operations are self-contained within the `Dictionary#invoke()` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the learn mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user types in `learn magic` into the CLI.

Step 2. `learn magic` will be parsed by LearnVocabularyParser, where the `learn` command will be triggered, calling `LearnCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3. This in turn calls `Dictionary` class and all of its relevant operations, starting with `Dictionary#invoke()`.

Step 4. The word `magic` will be checked against the model and the current LearnVocabulary to see if they hold the same exact word.

Step 4a. The word does not exist and will be stored, together with the meaning that was queried as a result of `Dictionary#invoke()`.

Step 4b. The word already exists and the command will throw a Duplicate Word Exception.

[NOTE]
The newly queried word would be attached with a "toLearn" tag, which allows the user to know that he/she just queried the word and can leave it for the future to learn it.

Step 5. The word, meaning will be assigned a default tag and be displayed in the Command Box.

The following sequence diagram shows how the learn command works:

image::LearnSequenceDiagram.png[width="820"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Words are queried in Dictionary
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Online querying of every word being learned.
** Pros: Easy to implement and change (in the future) to accommodate extra meanings.
** Cons: Requires the use of Internet Connection.
* **Alternative 2:** Offline querying of every word being learned.
** Pros: Does not require Internet to query word.
** Cons: Untested, but a corrupt xml file would be disastrous causing corrupt findings, memory space will be an issue as well.

===== Aspect: How Words are stored in Dictionary
* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Offline storage of every word being learned.
** Pros: Easy to implement and does not require the use of a cloud storage.
** Cons: Not mobile and accessible to the user
* **Alternative 2:** Online storage of every word being learned.
** Pros: Mobile access by the user on the go.
** Cons: Will consume a lot of resources. Might not be necessary.

// end::learn[]

// tag::group[]
=== Group features
==== Current Implementation
The group feature is mainly for user to manage their word lists inside our LearnVocabulary application and it now supports three functionalitys, which are groupadd, groupdelete, and showgroup.

===== groupadd functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the groupadd functionality mainly consists of a GroupaddCommandParser and a GroupaddCommand.
The groupadd parser is indicated as `GroupaddCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user, check its validity and delete whitespaces.
The groupadd command is indicated as `Groupadd` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to "add" a empty word group to the application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the groupadd functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1: User calls “groupadd + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the newly added group.

Step 2: `GroupAddCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user set a group name that has already existed, the system do nothing(no dublicate). Otherwise it creates a new group.

===== groupdelete functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the groupdelete functionality mainly consists of a GroupDeleteCommandParser and a GroupdeleteCommand.
The groupdelete parser is indicated as `GroupDeleteCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user.
The groupdelete command is indicated as `Groupdelete` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to "delete" a word group and all the words inside.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the groupdelete functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1: User calls “groupdelete + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the desired deleted group.

Step 2: `GroupDeleteCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user set a group name that does not exist, the system throw an exception. Otherwise it deletes the assigned group. Especially, for those words which exist in this only deleted group, those words would also be deleted automately.

===== showgroup functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the showgroup functionality mainly consists of a ShowGroupCommandParser and a ShowGroupCommand.
The showgroup parser is indicated as `ShowGroupCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user.
The showgroup command is indicated as `ShowGroup` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to either see all the existing groups or open a selected word group and see all the words inside.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the showgroup functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1: User calls “groupdelete + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the desired deleted group.

Step 2: `GroupDeleteCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user set a group name that does not exist, the system throw an exception. Otherwise it deletes the assigned group. Especially, for those words which exist in this only deleted group, those words would also be deleted automately.
// end::group[]

// tag::basic[]
=== Basic features
==== Current Implementation
Improved from the previous versions, the `Add` and `Edit` commands have been refined in LearnVocabulary.
There is also a minor feature added `Show`, which displays a filtered word list on the Ui.

===== Add command improvements
When adding a new word to LearnVocabulary, only the `Name` and `Meaning` fields must be entered as follows: `add n/fire m/something hot`.
As can be seen from the example given, there is no `Tag` being entered at all. However, LearnVocabulary will enforce that every word would
require at least one tag. As such, the default tag "toLearn" will be given to words without any tags at the start.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user types in `add n/fire m/something hot` into the CLI.

Step 2. `add n/fire m/something hot` will be parsed by LearnVocabularyParser, where the `add` command will be triggered, calling `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3a. Illegal characters will cause the command to throw an exception and await a new command.

Step 3b. The word with all letters being parsed will be checked against LearnVocabulary to ensure no duplicate words.

Step 4. The word will have a "toLearn" tag attached and be added to LearnVocabulary after ensuring that there are no duplicates.

===== Edit command improvements
When editing an existing word in LearnVocabulary, there cannot be empty tags for any words provided.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in `edit 1 t/` which shows the user wanting to clear all tags from existing word.

Step 2. The command box outputs that it is not possible, at least one tag must be attached to the word.

===== Show feature
The `show` command is an improvement in leaps and bounds ahead of the `find` command, but it exists as a separate command on its own due to its nature.
Simply put, when entering `show fire magic life`, it will display the 3 words on the Ui and automatically outputs
the word, meaning and tags onto the Command Box. The first word from the list will also be automatically selected.

As such, `Show` was implemented with a more Ui state of mind, to ensure the user's ease of use when finding the words for display of their meanings as AddressBook level 4 did not cater to this particular arrangement.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in `show fire magic life`, it will display the 3 words in the order that they had in the list.

[NOTE]
Multiple words are allowed to be queried. This allows for more flexibility compared to the Ui option.

Step 2. On the left, we have the filtered list of words. On the right we have the automatically selected first word from the list.

Step 3. The 3 words will appear in the Command Box as well.

// end::basic[]

=== Trivia feature

The trivia function is facilitated by `LearnVocabulary`.
Besides storing a `UniqueWordList`, `LearnVocabulary` also stores the current trivia question as `triviaQuestion` and stores a list of trivia questions is `triviaQuestionList`.
Scores for a trivia game are also stored using `currentScore` and `maxScore`.

Additionally, it also implements the following operations:

* `setTriviaList` -- sets the trivia question list based on the current vocabulary list
* `setTrivia` -- sets the trivia question based on `triviaQuestionList`
* `getTrivia` -- outputs the current trivia question.
* `updateScore` -- adds 1 to the the`currentScore`
* `clearTrivia` -- clears the current trivia question as well as removing it from the `triviaQuestionList`
* `isTriviaMode` -- a boolean to indicate whether the model is currently in trivia mode.
* `toggleTriviaMode` -- toggle trivia mode

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model.setTrivia()` and `Model.getTrivia()`.


Outlined below is how the trivia function operates at each step:

Step 1. The user inputs trivia in the CLI.

Step 2. `TriviaCommand.execute()` checks `lastShownList` to see if it is empty.

[NOTE]
If `lastShownList` is empty, `TriviaCommand.execute()` will terminate and a message will be displayed to the user indicating that the user has to add words in before `trivia` can be used

Step 3. `TriviaCommand.execute()` calls `toggleTriviaMode` to indicate that LearnVocabulary is in trivia mode.

[NOTE]
While in trivia mode, every command the user types will be parsed as `TriviaAnsCommand`. Trivia mode can be exited by either completing the trivia or typing "triviaExit"

Step 4. `TriviaCommand.execute()` now calls `Model.setTriviaList()` to set the trivia question within `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 5. `TriviaCommand.execute()` calls `Model.getTrivia()` and outputs to the user.

image::TriviaSequenceDiagram.png[width="820"]

**Answer**

The answer command is indicated as `TriviaAnsCommand` in `commands`. It will take in arguments passed in by the user and checks whether it is the correct/wrong answer to the current trivia question.

Outlined below is how the answer function operates:

Step 1: User enters  his/her argument.

[NOTE]
Attempting to call the `answer` command without first calling `trivia` will result in an error.

Step 2: `TriviaAnsCommandParser` processes the argument and parses it to `TriviaAnsCommand`.

Step 3: `TriviaAnsCommand.execute()` checks the passed argument is the same word as `triviaQuestion` in `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 4: Outputs a correct or wrong message based on the result in step 3.

**Select**

The select command is indicated as `SelectCommand` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It selects a word identified by a user using its index from the review list.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User calls “select + [index]” where `index` is the index of the word that the user wants to select.

Step 2: `SelectCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user leaves out or in other ways enters an invalid index, `SelectCommand` throws an exception. Otherwise it returns the desired word.

image::TriviaAnsSequenceDiagram.png[width="820"]

**Word Of The Day**

The Word Of The Day command is indicated as `WordOfTheDay` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It enables the user to display the current word of the day taken from website Dictionary.com. Similarly to the "learn" command, this command also requires a working internet connection. It is impossible to make this feature available offline since the word of the day cannot be predicted on Dictionary.com

Functions added:

* `Dictionary#doesWordOfTheDayExist()` -- Checks to see if the word of the day exist on Dictionary.com and returns the word of the day page as a Document object.
* `Dictionary#fetchWordOfTheDay()` -- Parses the word of the day and its meaning from the Document object returned by `doesWordOfTheDayExist()` and returns itself (Dictionary object).

Below is a description on how the Word Of The Day function operates:

Step 1: User cannot think of a word so he/she wants to display the word of the day on Dictionary.com.

Step 2: User would make sure that there is a working internet connection.

Step 3: User would type "word" into the command line.

Step 4: The word of the day will be fetched online. Should it be successful, the word of the day and its meaning will be displayed.



=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.learnvocabulary.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, LearnVocabulary depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all words in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParser.java[`LearnVocabularykParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParser.java[`LearnVocabularyParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the learnvocabulary, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the learnvocabulary.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/LearnVocabulary.java[`LearnVocabulary`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/LearnVocabulary.java[`LearnVocabulary`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/LearnVocabulary.java[`LearnVocabulary`] allows you to update a word, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/LearnVocabulary.java[`LearnVocabulary`]. Loop through each word, and remove the `tag` from each word.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `LearnVocabulary#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your learnvocabulary application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last word in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside word cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/WordCard.java[the `WordCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `WordCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/LearnVocabularykSystemTest.java[`LearnVocabularySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and LearnVocabularySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the learnvocabulary is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of words when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleLearnVocabularyChangedEvent(LearnVocabularyChangedEvent)`] to update the number of words whenever there are new changes to the learnvocabulary.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/LearnVocabularySystemTest.java[`LearnVocabularySystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of words status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the learnvocabulary to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the learnvocabulary after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the learnvocabulary storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupLearnVocabulary(ReadOnlyLearnVocabulary)`, so that the learnvocabulary can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/LearnVocabularyStorage.java[`LearnVocabularyStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/XmlLearnVocabularyStorage.java[`XmlLearnVocabularyStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `learnvocabulary`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a word specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first word to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first word.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParser.java[`LearnVocabularyParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParserTest.java[`LearnVocabularyParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParser.java[`LearnVocabularyParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/parser/LearnVocabularyParserTest.java[`LearnVocabularyParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `WordCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/WordCard.java[`WordCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/WordListCard.fxml[`WordListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/WordCard.java[`WordCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/WordCardHandle.java[`WordCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Meaning.java[`Meaning`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Word` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the word will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `learnVocabulary.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedWord` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Word` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/XmlAdaptedWord.java[`XmlAdaptedWord`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidWordLearnVocabulary.xml`, `typicalWordsLearnVocabulary.xml`, `validLearnVocabulary.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/testutil/WordBuilder.java[`WordBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/word/Word.java[`Word`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/testutil/WordBuilder.java[`WordBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Word` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/testutil/TypicalWords.java[`TypicalWords`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `WordCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/WordCard.java[`WOrdCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/WordCard.java[`WordCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Word` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Target user profile

People who would like to learn new words they see in their daily life more efficiently and use computer a lot. These people can be for example non-native english speakers and schools who want to use the program in language courses. In the future, target users will be extended to also other languages than english.

== Value propositions

The application helps the user to find the meaning of words. Upon finding the meaning of words, they will be stored into a “review list”, where the user can refresh their memory of the word that they had just learnt (similar to flash cards). In specific, we currently plan to give the user the meaning of the word and ask them to type the word correctly. If they can type in the word correctly for continuous several days, then the word will be deleted from the review list automatically. Besides, the user can also manually add words in the review list and delete words from the review list. In the end, this will help the user to learn the language.
