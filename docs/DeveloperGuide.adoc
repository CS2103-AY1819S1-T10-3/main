== Implemention
**Trivia:**

The trivia function is facilitated by `LearnVocabulary`.
Besides storing a `UniqueWordList`, `LearnVocabulary` also stores the current trivia question as `triviaQuestion`.

Additionally, it also implements the following operations:

* `setTrivia` -- sets the trivia question based on the current vocabulary list
* `getTrivia` -- outputs the current trivia question.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model.setTrivia()` and `Model.getTrivia()`.


Outlined below is how the trivia function operates at each step:

Step 1. The user inputs trivia in the CLI.

Step 2. `TriviaCommand.execute()` checks `lastShownList` to see if it is empty.

[NOTE]
If `lastShownList` is empty, `TriviaCommand.execute()` will terminate and a message will be displayed to the user indicating that the user has to add words in before `trivia` can be used

Step 3. `TriviaCommand.execute()` now calls `Model.setTrivia()` to set the trivia question within `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 4. `TriviaCommand.execute()` calls `Model.getTrivia` and outputs to the user.

**Answer**

The answer command is indicated as `TriviaAnsCommand` in `commands`. It will take in arguments passed in by the user and checks whether it is the correct/wrong answer to the current trivia question.

Outlined below is how the answer function operates:

Step 1: User calls `answer` with his/her argument.

[NOTE]
Attempting to call the `answer` command without first calling `trivia` will result in an error.

Step 2: `TriviaAnsCommandParser` processes the argument and parses it to `TriviaAnsCommand`.

Step 3: `TriviaAnsCommand.execute()` checks the passed argument is the same word as `triviaQuestion` in `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 4: Outputs a correct or wrong message based on the result in step 3.

**Select**

The select command is indicated as `SelectCommand` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It selects a word identified by a user using its index from the review list.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User calls “select + [index]” where `index` is the index of the word that the user wants to select.

Step 2: `SelectCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user leaves out or in other ways enters an invalid index, `SelectCommand` throws an exception. Otherwise it returns the desired word.

**groupadd**

The select command is indicated as `GroupAddCommand` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It create a new group in which the uesr can put words.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User calls “groupadd + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the newly added group.

Step 2: `GroupAddCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user set a group name that has already existed, the system do nothing(no dublicate). Otherwise it creates a new group.

**groupdelete**

The select command is indicated as `GroupDeleteCommand` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It delete a group and all words in it.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User calls “groupdelete + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the desired deleted group.

Step 2: `GroupDeleteCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user set a group name that does not exist, the system throw an exception. Otherwise it deletes the assigned group. Especially, for those words which exist in this only deleted group, those words would also be deleted automately.

**Show implementation**

The show command is indicated as `Show` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It is a more advanced version of `Find` in a sense that it displays the word's definition on the Ui screen page. The reason why this was created and `Find` was left alone was because we wanted to have more abstraction in terms of code.
As for `find`, perhaps the team and I can find another purpose for it.
As such, `Show` was implemented with a more Ui state of mind, to ensure the user's ease of use when finding the words for display of their meanings as AddressBook level 4 did not cater to this particular arrangement.
Moreover, it also encompasses multiple words, which meant that users can always pick and dump a whole bunch of words and it will filter out as needed, accordingly.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User wants to query a bunch of words and find out their meanings, tags altogether.

Step 2: `ShowCommand` checks through the entire xml file and filters out the ones being typed.

Step 3: The result is the list of filtered words, together with their definition and tags being displated.

**Learn**

The learn command is indicated as `Learn` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It enables the user to "learn" a word from the world wide web. This command is delicate in the sense that it requires the use of Internet, should there be an absence of Internet connection, it has already been taken care of via throwing an Exception. There was a discussion to have an "Offline" version of the dictionary so that we can better attend to the tests, especially since it might be an offline environment.
However, due to the lack of resources online and the fact that the API for dictionary only allows for 250 queries, we opted to do the online version instead.

Functions added:

* `Dictionary#invoke()` -- calls the main function of Dictionary which links it to LearnVocabulary
* `Dictionary#isConnectedToInternet()` -- checks to see if there is an Internet connection established.
* `Dictionary#isWordInOnlineDictionary()` -- checks to see if it is a valid word and if it exists in Dictionary.com

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User wants to learn this new word he just heard of, eg: Happiness

Step 2: User would type the word followed by the command learn, eg: learn happiness

Step 3: The word will be searched online, should it be successful, the word and meaning will be displayed on screen.

Step 4: The word is then stored within the storage file.

== Target user profile

People who would like to learn new words they see in their daily life more efficiently and use computer a lot. These people can be for example non-native english speakers and schools who want to use the program in language courses. In the future, target users will be extended to also other languages than english.

== Value propositions

The application helps the user to find the meaning of words. Upon finding the meaning of words, they will be stored into a “review list”, where the user can refresh their memory of the word that they had just learnt (similar to flash cards). In specific, we currently plan to give the user the meaning of the word and ask them to type the word correctly. If they can type in the word correctly for continuous several days, then the word will be deleted from the review list automatically. Besides, the user can also manually add words in the review list and delete words from the review list. In the end, this will help the user to learn the language.

== Use cases

**Add a word to the review list:**

User enters a word to add to the review list.

System checks if word exists in the dictionary and displays if the word could be successfully added or not. It also displays the meaning of the word.

Use case ends

**Finding a word in the review list or in the dictionary:**

User enters the word that he or she wants to look up

System checks that the word exists in the dictionary and displays the meaning of the word.

System also checks if the word is already in the review list and asks if the users wants to add it to the review list (if it is not already there).

Use case ends

*Trivia mode:*

MSS:
