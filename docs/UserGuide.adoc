== Introduction

LearnVocabulary is for those who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes.

More importantly, LearnVocabulary is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, LearnVocabulary can fetch the words faster than searching it on the website.
